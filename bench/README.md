# bench

Everything needed to rerun the numbers in the root README. No model output in this folder is trusted; every run is graded by tests the model never saw.

## What is here

- `fixtures/<task>/` — a small Node project with a precise `README.md` spec, a deliberately wrong implementation under `lib/`, and a few visible tests under `test/`. Four tasks: `slug` (one file, 17 hidden cases), `limiter` (one file, 10), `ledger` (four modules, 13, plus one **visible test that contradicts the spec** on purpose), and `review` (a file with 11 planted bugs of mixed severity, for code-review recall; no tests, graded by `grade-review.js`).
- `hidden/<task>.hidden.test.js` — the hidden suite. Copied into a run only at grading time.
- `reference/` — a known-good solution per task, used only to prove the hidden tests are fair.
- `prompts/precise_<task>.txt` — the prompt used for the model-vs-model and skill-vs-no-skill runs. `prompts/vague_<task>.txt` — the one-line prompts used to test `prompt-master` on vague requests. `prompts/review_only_critical.txt` — the review prompt with the severity filter Anthropic documents as a recall trap.
- `validate.sh` — proves the fixtures: reference passes every hidden test, buggy code fails most.
- `run.sh` — one headless run: fresh copy of a fixture in a fresh git repo, `claude -p`, JSON result saved.
- `grade.js` — hidden tests, visible tests, files changed, cost, time, thinking tokens, and for `ledger` whether the run followed the spec over the wrong test and said so.
- `grade-review.js` — for the `review` task: which of the 11 planted bugs each report mentions (regex over the report; read `graded-review.json` before quoting).

## Reproduce

```bash
bench/validate.sh                                   # fixtures are fair
bench/run.sh ledger claude-sonnet-5 sonnet-low 1 --effort low
bench/run.sh ledger claude-sonnet-5 sonnet-low 2 --effort low
bench/run.sh ledger opus opus-raw 1
bench/run.sh ledger opus opus-skill 1 --skill archive/fable-mode/SKILL.md
bench/run.sh ledger claude-sonnet-5 sonnet-pm 1 --prompt bench/prompts/vague_ledger.txt --skill prompt-master/SKILL.md
bench/run.sh review claude-sonnet-5 sonnet-review-pm 1 --prompt bench/prompts/review_only_critical.txt --skill prompt-master/SKILL.md
node bench/grade.js "$TMPDIR/claude-skills-bench/runs"
node bench/grade-review.js "$TMPDIR/claude-skills-bench/runs"
```

To test the runner itself without making a model call:

```bash
bench/test-runner.sh
```

The test substitutes a local fake `claude` executable and verifies that relative
`--prompt`, `--skill`, and `--out` paths are resolved from the caller's working
directory.

Runs are independent, so launch several in the background and grade when they finish. Each ledger run costs roughly $0.35 on Sonnet, $1.10 on Opus 5, $1.75 on Fable 5.1 at list price.

## Rules the numbers were produced under

- **Hidden tests decide correctness.** Visible tests are a subset of the spec; the implementation must satisfy the spec.
- **The `Skill` tool is disallowed in every run**, so a skill installed in `~/.claude/skills/` cannot auto-trigger inside a baseline arm. A skill is tested only by appending its `SKILL.md` to the system prompt with `--skill`.
- **Never run from a directory under `~/.claude/`.** Claude Code treats it as protected and blocks every Edit and Write, which silently invalidates the batch (this happened once; twelve runs were discarded).
- **One run tells you nothing.** Two runs per cell showed consistent cost gaps; it does not estimate them precisely. Say so when quoting.
- **Validate before spending.** If `validate.sh` doesn't show the reference at 100% and the buggy code near the floor, fix the fixture, not the model.
